# NZTRADER
Generic Java-based framework for trade automation

This framework is designed to have 
- flexibility in design of strategies (concepts of Macro and Micro strategies are introduced)
- to be linked to any exchange/broker interface
However, as of now it is limited to interact only to Interactive Brokers TWS. 
As a consequence, the 'JOrder' is a close copy of 'order' from IB.

Project files are setup for NetBeans.

Things to do (for those who wants to continue development of it):
- Framework perhaps can run on your computer (see Config xml files to change directories)
- Ensure it runs with current TWS/IB (might require change of IB wrapper)
